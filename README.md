This code trains the smiles dataset and detect if a person is smiling or not.
LeNet architecture has been used for training and haarcascade has been used for face detection.
The dataset of smiles will be uploaded to the dataset repository. Download and copy it to this folder.
Alternatively, the dataset can be created by applying haarcascade face detector on the google images and then seperate them into smiling and non smiling images.
